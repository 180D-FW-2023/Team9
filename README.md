# Team9
Our code here contains all the functionality of our project. When it starts up, the user says "Hey Buddy", and at that point they enter the menu. At that point they can access any of our major functionalities that include: Twitter, Spotify, ChatGPT, GPS Location, Rear-View Car Detection. The user uses their voice to activate any of the major functionalities just mentioned. If they want twitter they say "twitter". If they want ChatGPT they say Smart Chat. 



For bugs: One bug is that occasionally the rear-view car detection wont function correctly, and may crash the system, leading to the helmet needing to be restarted. 

Future imporvements would be fixing the major rear-view crashing bug. Also we could consider further threshold optimization.
